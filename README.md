Uses livestreamer to capture
The Video_folder must have the full path or is a folder in the same directory as CaptureBate.

Requirements
==========
python

[Livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer) used to capture the streams.

[BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4/4.3.2) the screen-scraping library.

[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) compiled with support for `libmp3lame` & `libspeex` audio for converting the output files.

Setup
===========

Install requirements `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

Get a [chaturbate account](https://chaturbate.com/accounts/register/), once you're signed up put your credentials in the `config.conf` file and - if needed - adjust the other options.

NOTE: if you find captures aren't starting set an absolute directory for captures in `config.conf` like so `Video_folder = /home/user/CaptureBate/Captured`

Be mindful when capturing many streams at once to have plenty of space on disk and the bandwidth available or you'll endup dropping a lot of frames and the files will be useless.

Before you can start capturing streams you first need to [follow](https://i.imgur.com/o9QyAVC.png) the models you want on site and then paste their usernames into the `wishlist.txt` file, once you have done this you're ready to start `main.py`

Running & Output
===========
On linux:
To start capturing streams you need to run `python main.py` I reccomend you do this in [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) as there is no output and it can just be left running in the background. To see what's going on run `tail -f output.log`
On windows:
Start the main.py file, and the python window will have some basic information. If you want you can get tail for windows or something, and look at the output.log file.

Standard output should look something this when recording streams ..

Encoding
===========

The streams i get with livestreamer is h264 video and aac audio, so doesn't seem to be any need for converting, but you might get different.
